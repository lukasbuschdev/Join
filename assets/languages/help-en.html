        <h3>What is Join?</h3>
        <p>Join is a Kanban-based project management tool designed and developed by a group of dedicated students as part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Academy.</p>
        <p>Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard," is an extremely effective method for visualizing work, limiting work in progress, and maximizing efficiency (or flow). Join uses the principles of Kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.</p>
        <p>It's important to note that Join is designed as an educational exercise and is not intended for extensive business applications. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot guarantee consistent availability, reliability, accuracy, or other quality aspects related to Join.</p>
