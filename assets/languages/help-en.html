        <h3>What is Join?</h3>
        <p>Join is a Kanban-based project management tool designed and developed by a group of dedicated students as part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Academy.</p>
        <p>Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard," is an extremely effective method for visualizing work, limiting work in progress, and maximizing efficiency (or flow). Join utilizes the principles of Kanban to assist users in managing their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.</p>
        <p>It's important to note that Join is designed for educational purposes and is not intended for extensive business applications. While we strive to provide the best user experience possible, we cannot guarantee consistent availability, reliability, accuracy, or other quality aspects of Join.</p>

        <h3>How to Use It</h3>
        <p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use Join:</p>
        <ul class="column gap-20">
            <li>
                <h3>Explore the Board</h3>
                <p>When you log in to Join, you have the option to create a new board. This board represents your project and includes four default lists:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"To Do"</li>
                    <li>"In Progress"</li>
                    <li>"Waiting for Feedback"</li>
                    <li>"Done"</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You can add new cards to the board by clicking the "New Task" button. It's also possible to search for specific content within the cards of the currently selected board.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Add Contacts</h3>
                <p>In Join, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts" section, click the "New Contact" button, and enter the username. Once you've selected the contact and clicked the "Add Contact" button, a request will be sent, which the recipient must confirm. Afterward, you can assign tasks to this contact and others if they have been added to the respective board previously.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Add Cards</h3>
                <p>You can add cards on the "New Task" page. Cards represent individual tasks. Click the "Add Task" button to create a new card. First, select a board, and then fill out the task details in the card, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Title</li>
                    <li>Description</li>
                    <li>Category</li>
                    <li>Members</li>
                    <li>Due Date</li>
                    <li>Priority</li>
                </ul>
                <p>(Subtasks are optional.)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Move Cards</h3>
                <p>When a task transitions from one phase to another, you can display it on the board by dragging and dropping the card from one list to another.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Edit Cards</h3>
                <p>Clicking on a card opens it, and you can edit all the task details using the "Edit" button.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Delete Cards</h3>
                <p>When a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it. Deleting a card permanently removes it from the board. Please be cautious when deleting cards, as this action cannot be undone.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>User Card</h3>
                <p>When you click on the button located in the upper right corner with your profile picture, a card with the following options opens:</p>
                <ul class="column gap-20">
                    <li>
                        <h4>Notifications</h4>
                        <p class="margin-5">Here, you can see notifications related to boards you've been added to, as well as contact requests.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Edit Account</h4>
                        <p class="margin-5">Here, you can edit your profile picture, username, email, password, and profile color.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Language</h4>
                        <p class="margin-5">Here, you can set your user language using the buttons.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Log Out</h4>
                        <p class="margin-5">Use this button to log out.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
